# MarinSox
A tiny noise generator script to help people fall asleep

WHAT IT DO: This is a shell script that, if made executable, will
run prompt the user to select a type of [PINK | WHITE | BROWN ] Noise 
that will then be played. As of now only basic Noises can be played.  
Hopefully, in the future a more cutomized set of modulation and frequency options
will be added. The Noise is generated by the SoX audio program. It is 
relaxing and it might help you fall asleep.
